			The coronavirus lockdown has been a testing time for all of us. However, some have faced more difficulties than the rest of us. These include the elderly, daily wagers, low-income families, frontline workers, and the police. Many have faced a shortage of food supplies and many have gone through the anxiety of staying away from their families.
			<br><br>
